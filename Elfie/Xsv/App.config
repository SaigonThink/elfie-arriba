    <!-- Xsv is extensible. To add support for new readers or writers:
          - Add a key starting with "ITabularReader" to add a reader or "ITabularWriter" to add a writer.
          - The value should be the file extension supported, the assembly to load, and the namespace and type name.
          - The reader or writer must have a constructor taking only a string (the path or URL of the content to read or write)
          
          Ex: <add key="ITabularReader.ss" value="ss;Elfie.SS;Elfie.SS.Serialization.StructuredStreamReader" />
